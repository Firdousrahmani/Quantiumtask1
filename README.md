Customer Segmentation for a Retail Client

# 🧠 Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship - Task 1

This project is part of the **Quantium Virtual Internship** hosted by Forage. I took on the role of a **Data Analyst** in the retail division, focusing on understanding chip-buying behavior through customer transaction data.

---

## 📌 Task 1 Objective

To help the **Category Manager for Chips** understand:
- Who buys chips?
- How often do they purchase?
- How much do they spend?
- Which customer segments drive the most sales?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- 📈 Seaborn & Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- 🧹 Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- 📁 Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Data Sources

- `QVI_transaction_data.xlsx` – contains transaction details for chip purchases  
- `QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv` – customer demographic and segmentation info

---

## ✅ Key Steps Performed

• Imported and cleaned raw transaction data  
• Removed promotional/bulk transactions (`PROD_QTY > 1`)  
• Merged customer and transaction datasets on `LYLTY_CARD_NBR`  
• Analyzed chip sales across `LIFESTAGE` and `PREMIUM_CUSTOMER` segments  
• Generated visualizations for total sales by customer group  
• Derived actionable insights for marketing and strategy

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

• **YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES** and **RETIREES** are top contributors to total sales  
• **Mainstream customers** tend to spend more than Budget customers  
• Clear segmentation allows for better targeting and promotional planning
